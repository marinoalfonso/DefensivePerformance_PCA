# Application of PCA & Multiple Linear Regression with football data

This research combines the power of 𝑷𝒓𝒊𝒏𝒄𝒊𝒑𝒂𝒍 𝑪𝒐𝒎𝒑𝒐𝒏𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝑨𝒏𝒂𝒍𝒚𝒔𝒊𝒔 (𝑷𝑪𝑨) and 𝑴𝒖𝒍𝒕𝒊𝒑𝒍𝒆 𝑳𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒂𝒓 𝑹𝒆𝒈𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒔𝒊𝒐𝒏 to uncover unique insights into team performances. All analyses were conducted using the statistical software 𝑹.

## Key Hihglihts
𝑫𝒂𝒕𝒂𝒔𝒆𝒕 𝑶𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒗𝒊𝒆𝒘: We analyzed comprehensive data on defensive actions from teams in Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, La Liga, and the Premier League.

𝑫𝒆𝒔𝒄𝒓𝒊𝒑𝒕𝒊𝒗𝒆 𝑨𝒏𝒂𝒍𝒚𝒔𝒊𝒔: Utilized statistical tools and graphs to understand the distribution and key metrics of the dataset.

𝑫𝒊𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒔𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒚 𝑹𝒆𝒅𝒖𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒉 𝑷𝑪𝑨: Simplified complex data to highlight the primary components driving team behaviors.

𝑴𝒖𝒍𝒕𝒊𝒑𝒍𝒆 𝑳𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒂𝒓 𝑹𝒆𝒈𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒔𝒊𝒐𝒏: Investigated linear relationships among variables to identify key performance indicators.

This study reveals the diverse defensive styles and strategies adopted by different teams, influenced by their coaches' tactical philosophies and the players' unique skills.
